# USAGE
#### see INSTALL or SETUP; all information here is included.. see `-h --install` `-h --setup`
#### for detailed descriptions read the ARCH if I write it ...

The only slightly confusing this about this tool is it has a lot of args, and you can do some reasonably unusual things to the arg stack ( I think; of course no statement is finished ). Any command of which there only the main functions of the tool can also be an argument. You can overload the order for example when using in slightly variation aliases.

    - not going to automate this at first, unless I can find some code that makes it sort of work. Or libraries do this well.. I think its easy enough from what the kernels tell you....
